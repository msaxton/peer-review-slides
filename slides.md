## Peer Review


### What is peer review?

Peer review is a collaborative process that allows independent experts in the same field of research to evaluate and comment on manuscript submissions.


### What peer review is NOT:
* Copy-editing
* Arbitrary agreement or disagreement


### Peer reviewers do not need to agree with an author's conclusions, they check that...

* the work makes an original contribution

* the methodology is appropriate and clearly described

* the work engages with relevant and current scholarship

* the ideas are clearly presented

* conclusions are reliable and supported by research


### What does useful feedback look like?

### Examples (from Taylor & Francis Peer Reviewer Guidelines):

"The subject is very important. It’s currently something of a “hot topic”, and is one to which the author has made significant contributions."

"Given the complexity involved, the author has produced many positive and welcome outcomes. The literature review offers a useful overview of current research and policy, and the resulting bibliography provides a very useful resource for current practitioners."

"I don’t think that this article contains enough robust data to evidence the statement made on page X, lines Y–Z."

"There is an interesting finding in this research about…. However, there is insufficient discussion of exactly what this finding means and its implications."

"There are a few sentences that need rephrasing for clarity..."


### Peer reviewers will make a recommendation
* **Accept** - The work is ready for publication.
* **Minor revisions** - The work needs only minor revisions.
* **Major revisions** - Much of the work needs to be expanded or rewritten before it is suitable for publication.
* **Reject** - The work is either out of scope for the publication or contains fundamental deficiencies making it unfit for publication. 


### Why is peer review useful?
* For the scholarly community?
* for the reviewer?
* for the author?


### Peer (and self) review for this class:
Evaluate the following on a scale of 1 (needs improvement) to 5 (excellent). Give a few sentences explaining your evaluation.

(Remember you are only viewing ~5 pages of a complete work)

* The ideas are clearly expressed.

* The transitions between sections and/or paragraphs are smooth and logical.

* The author demostrates an informed knowledge of the subject matter.

* If there is an introduction present, it clearly states the research question and defines the themes, scope, and sequence of the review.

* If there is a conclusion present, it briefly summarizes the major trends and themes in the literature and identifies areas open for further research.
